## About the project
Within this repository, You will find find folders which help implement Jekyll. Jekyll is a very powerful static sitegenerator. In some senses, it is a throwback to the days of static HTML before databases were used to store website content. For simple sites without complex architectures, like a personal website, this is a huge plus. When used alongside GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for your website each time you commit a file.

You will find the follwing directories that contain HTML code and Css file:
1. '_layout': This directory contains the default.html and post.html file.
2. '_posts': This is used to store individual blog posts.
3. 'Blog' : It's used to list each post, you'll use a foreach loop to create an unordered list of our blog posts.
4. 'css' : Contains the css file to style our webpage.

## Config directory
In Jekyll you can control the structure of our permalinks by editing the _config.yml file,It tells Jekyll some basics about your project.
